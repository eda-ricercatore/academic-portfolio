"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting the scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy. It involves acquiring experimental data that tests if my hypothesis of a teaching practice improves student outcomes over a semester.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different recently-taught concepts.

"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning and applying certain knowledge. I plan to facilitate shared learning: by assigning group projects for a course; provide allocated time for small group discussion during classes; award extra credit to students who open source their study notes and project deliverables, so that other people can learn from their work and build upon it; and have a in-class panel discussion with faculty, postdocs, and staff to share their experiences of applying what they learned in a comparable course in the workplace.

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different (socioeconomic) backgrounds, including students of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To practice this, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to delve into the material more to improve personalization of the teaching process.

As a teaching assistant and mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach certain concepts. I try adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity that I read from academic literature regarding broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Being a resident of a multicultural learning and living community at USC, and being involved in culture-specific student organizations, like MSC CAMAC, helps me learn from students of different perspectives.
