"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting the scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different concepts that have been taught in class during the past week. In addition, I can acquire experimental data that tests if my hypothesis of a teaching practice improves student outcomes over a semester.

"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning and applying certain knowledge. I plan to facilitate shared learning by assigning group projects for a course, and provide allocated time for small group discussion during classes. Moreover, I would award extra credit to students who open source their study notes and project deliverables, so that other people can learn from their work and build upon it. I plan to have a in-class panel discussion with faculty, postdocs, and staff to explain their choices of applying what they learned in a comparable course (as undergraduates) in the workplace and show the variety of opportunities to apply their acquired skills.

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different (socioeconomic) backgrounds, including students of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To practice this, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to delve into the material more to improve personalization of the teaching process.

E.g., as a teaching assistant and mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach them certain concepts. I try to keep up academic literature regarding broadening participation in engineering and computer science, so that I can adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity. Being a resident of a multicultural learning and living community at USC, and being involved in culture-specific student organizations, like MSC CAMAC, helps me learn from students of different perspectives.
