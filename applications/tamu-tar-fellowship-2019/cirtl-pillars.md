"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different concepts that have been taught in class during the past week.

"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning certain knowledge as well as producing deliverables to demonstrate the knowledge that they have acquired. This can be implemented via group projects for a course, or via residential communities in a residential college/hall (or dormitory).

Apart from group projects for my coursework, I have experienced living with learning communities in residential colleges at the University of Adelaide and the University of Southern California.

Also, I have participated in activities organized by MSC CAMAC, which is a learning community to help students learn about issues facing the Latinx community and Latinx subcultures.

"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, such as students from traditionally underrepresented/marginalized communities in academia (specifically ECE, for my case), as well as students of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To improve student learning by utilizing different strengths of the diverse class of students, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to dig deeper into the material as they teach their peers, and explain concepts in personalized ways so that students can feel connected to others in the class. They also get exposed to and can experiment with different forms/styles of communication, and help to improve the inclusiveness of the teams that they belong to.

This would entail learning about each other's challenges and subcultures that each team member identifies with, as they make accommodations for and support each other. Subsequently, this can improve their ability to network socially and professionally.

E.g., as a teaching assistant and as a mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach them certain concepts. I try to encourage peer tutoring, since I recognize that students can connect with their peers better than with me. I try to keep up academic literature regarding broadening participation in engineering and computer science, so that I can adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity.
