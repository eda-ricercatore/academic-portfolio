"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different concepts that have been taught in class during the past week.

"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning certain knowledge as well as producing deliverables to demonstrate the knowledge that they have acquired. This can be implemented via group projects for a course, or via residential communities in a residential college/hall (or dormitory).

Apart from group projects for my coursework, I have experienced living with learning communities in residential colleges at the University of Adelaide and the University of Southern California.

Also, I have participated in activities organized by MSC CAMAC, which is a learning community to help students learn about issues facing the Latinx community and Latinx subcultures.    

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different (socioeconomic) backgrounds, including students of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To utilize different strengths of the students so that student learning can be improved, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to delve into the material more to improve personalization of the teaching process.

E.g., as a teaching assistant and as a mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach them certain concepts. I try to keep up academic literature regarding broadening participation in engineering and computer science, so that I can adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity.
