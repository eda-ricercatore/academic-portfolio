1.i)
I want to use the flipped classroom model to expose electrical/computer engineering (ECE) students to contemporary and emerging technologies for electronic system design and prototyping of cyber-physical systems. I believe that it is more effective for students to go over lecture material on their own, at their own pace, and use lab sessions to acquire practical skills and troubleshoot problems that they encounter in class assignments and course projects. This can help them acquire sound practices that enable them to work more productively.

By exposing ECE students to emerging technologies developed during research activities at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and elsewhere, they can develop skills that allow them to start doing research earlier. Also, if such emerging technologies are widely adopted in industry, it would give ECE students that I taught a competitive advantage over their peers.

To the best of my knowledge, most ECE classes at TAMU do not expose students to emerging technologies, such as Chisel (Constructing Hardware in an Scala Embedded Language from UC Berkeley) and parameterized system-on-chip (SoC) synthesis software (for the RISC-V ISA). Some companies have adopted the use of Chisel and SoC synthesis software (based on the RISC-V ISA).

I am developing a set of Scala- and Chisel- based models of uniprocessors, multi- and many- core processors, and application-specific systems-on-chip (SoCs) synthesis software. I plan to use them during teaching activities.

In addition, I would assign students to teams that have students from different ethnic/religious backgrounds and competencies, and get them to work on course projects with teammates from a similar course taught simultaneously at a peer institution. This helps them learn to work with in diverse teams that are geographically distributed.

1.ii)
I would test this by teaching them using the traditional model of pedagogy to learn contemporary technologies early in the semester, and the flipped classroom model to teach them emerging technologies during the latter part of the semester.

If they can learn the emerging technologies, which have lesser learning resources available to them than contemporary technologies, just as well as contemporary technologies, I posit that the flipped classroom model works well for teaching certain ECE courses. That is, if their productivity does not degrade in learning emerging technologies, I would have demonstrated that the flipped classroom model is more effective and efficient than the traditional model.

Regarding the soft skills that they would hone during the course, I would get them to individually describe in a report what they have learned in collaborating with students of different cultural/academic backgrounds.

1.iii)
I would adopt an opt-in data analytics approach to demonstrate improved learning using the flipped classroom model.

When students incrementally update their repositories for their assignments and projects on GitHub, I can collect certain data such as the number of test cases passed and the number of lines of source code for each update. The set of chosen metrics would measure their productivity for a period of time (duration between updates).

2.i)
I aspire to be a tenure-track assistant professor at a research university. As a professor, I aspire to educate the next generation of engineers, broaden participation of students from traditionally underrepresented/marginalized communities in electrical/computer engineering and computer science, and do research to make an impact in design automation and computer architecture.

I want to expose undergraduates, including frosh students and sophomores taking introductory classes, to emerging technologies. This enables them to start doing research before the end of their junior year.

2.ii)
I hope to have demonstrated my ability to explore new techniques and models of pedagogy to improve student learning outcomes.

This would help me write my teaching statement when I apply for jobs in academia.

3.i)
"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different concepts that have been taught in class during the past week.

3.ii)
"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning certain knowledge as well as producing deliverables to demonstrate the knowledge that they have acquired. This can be implemented via group projects for a course, or via residential communities in a residential college/hall (or dormitory).

Apart from group projects for my coursework, I have experienced living with learning communities in residential colleges at the University of Adelaide and the University of Southern California.

Also, I have participated in activities organized by MSC CAMAC, which is a learning community to help students learn about issues facing the Latinx community and Latinx subcultures.    

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from students who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds, including students from traditionally underrepresented/marginalized communities in academia (specifically ECE, for my case).

By faciliting their mentoring and peer tutoring of each other, students can learn to work in diverse teams that are inclusive. They get to experiment with different forms/styles of communication and help to improve the inclusiveness of the teams that they belong to.

This would probably entail learning about each other's challenges and subcultures that each team member identifies with, as they make accommodations for and support each other. Subsequently, this can improve their ability to network socially and professionally.

E.g., I can teach a course that is concurrently taught at a Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and/or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), or with another research university in Europe, the Middle East, or Asia.
