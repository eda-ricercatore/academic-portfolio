1.i) My research question is whether performing data analytics about students' academic performance and frequent feedback about class/laboratory instruction can be used to improve intervention strategies for struggling students by course instructors and teaching assistants (TAs).

Data analytics can help to reduce drop-out rates from the course, academic program, or from the university, if intervention strategies are implemented early on (before the first midterm) to recognize early signs of students struggling in introductory courses of electrical/computer engineering (ECE, e.g., ECEN 248 on logic design).

1.ii)
Firstly, the sections of ECEN 248 are split into a control group and an experimental/treatment group.

For the control group, instructors would have no additional help to use data science to improve their teaching strategies during the course of the semester.

For the treatment group, I would acquire data about students' academic performance and weekly feedback about class/laboratory instruction, and analyze and visualize such data on a weekly basis that is shared with the instructors. Instructors can use these information to modify their teaching strategies to improve student learning outcomes.

By tracking the teaching strategies used in the intervention of academic struggles, and continuous monitoring of students' academic performance, we can determine if intervention strategies are successful. Multiple regression can be used to analyze the statistical correlation between the teaching strategies used in the intervention process with the academic performance of the academically struggling students.

1iii)
I would collection the following information:
a) student grades from each component of the course assessment;
b) the type of teaching strategies to intervene in academic struggles, and time/date and extent (in person-minutes) of intervention - strategies include re-teaching the concepts, providing additional office hours to struggling students, and in-class peer instruction;
c) number of student contributions to their GitHub repository for the ECEN 248 course, their extent (i.e., lines of code), for their Verilog-based logic design assignments and their results from simulating their Verilog designs against TA-provided testbenches; and
d) frequent feedback (quantitative and unstructured data) from students about class and laboratory instruction.

2.i)
I aspire to be a tenure-track assistant professor at a research university. I want to educate future generation of engineers, broaden participation of students from traditionally underrepresented communities in ECE, and do research to make an impact in design automation and computer architecture.

2.ii)
I hope to demonstrate my ability to use data science to adjust teaching strategies to improve student learning outcomes in ECE. I want improve my teaching philosophy with this teaching-as-research experience to be more supportive of academically struggling students.

3.i)
"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting the scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy. It involves acquiring experimental data that tests if my hypothesis of a teaching practice improves student outcomes over a semester.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different recently-taught concepts.

3.ii)
"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning and applying certain knowledge. I plan to facilitate shared learning: by assigning group projects for a course; provide allocated time for small group discussion during classes; award extra credit to students who open source their study notes and project deliverables, so that other people can learn from their work and build upon it; and have a in-class panel discussion with faculty, postdocs, and staff to share their experiences of applying what they learned in a comparable course in the workplace.

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different (socioeconomic) backgrounds, and of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To practice this, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to delve into the material more to improve personalization of the teaching process.

As a TA and mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach certain concepts. I try adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity that I read from academic literature regarding broadening participation in ECE. Being a resident of a multicultural learning and living community at USC, and being involved in culture-specific student organizations, like MSC CAMAC, helps me learn from students of different perspectives.
