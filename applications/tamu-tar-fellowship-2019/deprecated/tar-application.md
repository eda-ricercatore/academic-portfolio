1.i)
I want to use the flipped classroom model to expose electrical/computer engineering (ECE) students to contemporary and emerging technologies for electronic system design and prototyping of cyber-physical systems. I believe that it is more effective for students to go over lecture material on their own, at their own pace, and use lab sessions to acquire practical skills and troubleshoot problems that they encounter in class assignments and course projects. This can help them acquire sound practices that enable them to work more productively.

By exposing ECE students to emerging technologies developed during research activities at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and elsewhere, they can develop skills that allow them to start doing research earlier. Also, if such emerging technologies are widely adopted in industry, it would give ECE students that I taught a competitive advantage over their peers.

To the best of my knowledge, most ECE classes at TAMU do not expose students to emerging technologies, such as Chisel (Constructing Hardware in an Scala Embedded Language from UC Berkeley) and parameterized system-on-chip (SoC) synthesis software (for the RISC-V ISA). Some companies have adopted the use of Chisel and SoC synthesis software (based on the RISC-V ISA).

I am developing a set of Scala- and Chisel- based models of uniprocessors, multi- and many- core processors, and application-specific systems-on-chip (SoCs) synthesis software. I plan to use them during teaching activities.

In addition, I would assign students to teams that have students from different ethnic/religious backgrounds and competencies, and get them to work on course projects with teammates from a similar course taught simultaneously at a peer institution. This helps them learn to work with in diverse teams that are geographically distributed.

1.ii)
I would test this by teaching them using the traditional model of pedagogy to learn contemporary technologies early in the semester, and the flipped classroom model to teach them emerging technologies during the latter part of the semester.

If they can learn the emerging technologies, which have lesser learning resources available to them than contemporary technologies, just as well as contemporary technologies, I posit that the flipped classroom model works well for teaching certain ECE courses. That is, if their productivity does not degrade in learning emerging technologies, I would have demonstrated that the flipped classroom model is more effective and efficient than the traditional model.

Regarding the soft skills that they would hone during the course, I would get them to individually describe in a report what they have learned in collaborating with students of different cultural/academic backgrounds.

1.iii)
I would adopt an opt-in data analytics approach to demonstrate improved learning using the flipped classroom model.

When students incrementally update their repositories for their assignments and projects on GitHub, I can collect certain data such as the number of test cases passed and the number of lines of source code for each update. The set of chosen metrics would measure their productivity for a period of time (duration between updates).

2.i)
I aspire to be a tenure-track assistant professor at a research university. As a professor, I want to educate the next generation of engineers, broaden participation of students from traditionally underrepresented/marginalized communities in electrical/computer engineering and computer science, and do research to make an impact in design automation and computer architecture that leads to societal and economic benefits.

2.ii)
I hope to demonstrate my ability to explore new techniques and models of pedagogy to improve student learning outcomes in computer engineering. In particular, I want to test pedagogical practices to help students learn emerging technologies, such as (INSERT appropriate technology for relevant course), under a mutually influential framework for teaching and research.

The students would learn open source research deliverables for (electronic design automation, computer architecture, formal verification, compiler design, program/software analysis, or hardware security), which helps disseminates research to students and others, and improve testing of research deliverables.

These would help me write my teaching statement when I apply for jobs in academia.






3.i)
"Teaching-as-Research" refers to adopting the scientific approach to experimenting with new techniques and models of pedagogy. It involves acquiring experimental data that tests if my hypothesis of a teaching practice improves student outcomes over a semester.

By adopting a data analytics approach to teaching, I can quantify how the students are learning over time, and when cliques of them demonstrate difficulties in learning different recently-taught concepts.

3.ii)
"Learning Communities" refers to groups of students assembled for the purpose of learning and applying certain knowledge. I plan to facilitate shared learning: by assigning group projects for a course; provide allocated time for small group discussion during classes; award extra credit to students who open source their study notes and project deliverables, so that other people can learn from their work and build upon it; and have a in-class panel discussion with faculty, postdocs, and staff to share their experiences of applying what they learned in a comparable course in the workplace.

3.iii)
"Learning through Diversity" refers to learning with and from a diverse community of students. This includes students from different (socioeconomic) backgrounds, including students of different identities, (dis)abilities, and learning styles.

To practice this, I would encourage peer tutoring by award extra credit to students who can create write-ups, videos, or demonstrations for students of different learning styles, professional/academic interests, and motivation, and share them with other students. This also encourages students to delve into the material more to improve personalization of the teaching process.

As a teaching assistant and mentor, I try to understand students' motivations, career goals, and socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, so that I can personalize how I teach certain concepts. I try adopt good/best practices for inclusive diversity that I read from academic literature regarding broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Being a resident of a multicultural learning and living community at USC, and being involved in culture-specific student organizations, like MSC CAMAC, helps me learn from students of different perspectives.
